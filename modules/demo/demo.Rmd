## Welcome

Welcome to fellow instructors and activity designers for the CSBC Summer Research Program Mini-DREAM challenge. The purpose of this demo is to introduce the environment in students (and you) will be working to complete weekly activities for the challenge. This instance of RStudio is currently running on an Amazon EC2 instance (accessible at a public URL). Each instructor/administrator and each student will have a separate login to RStudio, so they can access course materials concurrently.

## R Notebooks

> Below is some boilerplate description of R Notebooks provided by RStudio when creating a new file. I'll leave it here, rather than trying to come up with my own description.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

## Building activities

Folders and RStudio projects for each module (0 through 5) should be available in each users home directory. To get started on your module activity, switch to the appropriate project and open up the file labelled **`module<#>.Rmd`** (where '<#>' will be replaced with your actual module number.)

From there, it's all straightforward R Markdown: add free-form text as needed, and create chunks for any code you want students to execute.

When you're done, we'll place a copy of your module working directory in every student's home directory.

## Environment

This instance comes pre-loaded with `tidyverse`, `devtools`, and the default set of Bioconductor packages. If you need to add additional packages, contact me so that I can make them available to all users.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Accessing data

All METABRIC data can be accessed at `"/home/shared/data/brca_metabric/"`. The data hasn't yet been split into training/testing/validaton cohorts, but that should happen by next Tuesday.

**Note:** students will have read, but not write access to the data in `"/home/shared/"`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
patient_data_file <- "/home/shared/data/brca_metabric/data_clinical_supp_patient.txt"
patient_df <- read_tsv(patient_data_file)
head(patient_df)
```

## Computing resources

The current instance type is **t2.micro** (which qualifies for the free tier on EC2). This instance type has very minimal resources, so I would advise against doing much heavy computing -- at this point, the goal is to get familiar with the environment and R Notebooks. We can resize to a more powerful instance whenever we're ready to start working with genomics data or predictive model building.
