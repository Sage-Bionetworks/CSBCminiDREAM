# The mini-DREAM Challenge

## Why are you here?

- To complement your research projects with the **CSBC/PS-ON Summer Research Program**...

- Our goals for this mini-DREAM Challenge are to:
    - Introduce you to **data science** and **basic model building**
    - Educate you on **cancer** and some specific biology related to breast cancer
    - Guide you through realistic analysis activities to solve common problems

## But what's a "challenge"?

- Crowd-sourced data challenges (e.g., Kaggle): participants submit their own attempts to answer complex questions from a common dataset

```{r, out.width="300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("dream-logo.png")
```

- **DREAM Challenges** (<a href="http://dreamchallenges.org/" target="_blank">website</a>): focused on biomedical datasets and questions, with the goal of improving ability to understand and predict disease outcomes

- Open, incentivized competitions through DREAM have led to important insights and benchmarks

## Breast Cancer Prognosis DREAM Challenge

- Goal: assess accuracy of computational models designed to predict **breast cancer survival** based on clinical information as well as genome-wide molecular measurement data

- **METABRIC dataset**: 2,000 breast cancer samples, 1,000 of which were provided to participants to train models

- Solutions improved over duration of the challenge; results and lessons from challenge published in 2013:
    - Margolin, et al. *Science Translational Medicine*
    - Cheng, et al. *Science Translational Medicine*

## CSBC mini-DREAM Challenge

- Same data and questions as original Breast Cancer Prognosis DREAM Challenge

- ***You*** will work with the data and step through the process of building predictive models for cancer survival

- Module lectures will cover basics of concepts related to computational modeling and breast cancer

# Course Roadmap

## Challenge modules

What to expect (also on <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8650663/wiki/436427" target="_blank">**Challenge Modules**</a> page):

- **Module 0**: Welcome, setup, & orientation
- **Module 1**: Introduction to R
- **Module 2**: Introduction to breast cancer & basic modeling
- **Module 3**: Working with genomic data
- **Module 4**: The curse of dimensionality
- **Module 5**: Integrating biological knowledge

If this doesn't make sense to you right now, that's OK!

*Each module builds on the previous &mdash; designed to guide you step-by-step through what you need to do.*

## Challenge activities

- Each module includes a hands-on programming activity in **R**

- As part of activities, you'll submit your own predictions to the Challenge

- Results show up on scoreboards, but this **isn't a competition**! We'll teach you exactly how to build models &mdash; scoreboards are just a fun way to track your progress.

## Beyond mini-DREAM

What to do after this course?

- Learn more about R, data science, and computational biology! (lots of free resources online)
- Participate in a real DREAM Challenge
- Use these approaches in your own research

# Course Setup

## Getting registered

Before diving into the course, we'll need to pause for a moment and make sure that everyone is ***registered*** on Synapse and for the mini-DREAM Challenge.

## Registering for Synapse

Most of you should already be registered on Synapse. If not, move ahead to the next slide and follow the instructions to register for the Challenge (you'll be asked to register for Synapse in the process).

## Registering for the Challenge

Instructions for registering for the **mini-DREAM Challenge** can be found <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8650663/wiki/436444" target="_blank">**here**</a>. 

When we get to **Module 1**, you'll need to be registered (and certified) in order to submit predictions to the challenge for scoring. *Consider this your homework assignment before the next meeting.*

# R

## What is R?

- Powerful programming language designed for doing statistical analyses

- Great tools for exploring, visualizing, and manipulating data

- Open source: free to use, with huge community that is constantly contributing new packages

## Why use R?

- Widely used by data scientists in technology industries and academic research

- Rich ecosystem of tools for specific data types and applications (e.g., **Bioconductor** packages for computational biology)

- Get a job? R was 3rd highest paid programming language in 2016 (<a href="http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/15-highest-paying-programming-languages-2016-01559832" target="_blank">Business2Community</a>)

## Why not use ____?

- Python also widely used for data science (and plenty of other software applications)

- Other relevant languages for modeling? Matlab, Julia, Java, Perl

- R still more popular in biomedical research community (and it's what *we* use for most analysis), but above languages can be great too!

## How will I use R for the mini-DREAM Challenge?

- No prior programming knowledge required!

- Most mini-DREAM R activities will provide code for you &mdash; just point and click

- Goal is to show you what R does and how it can help you, not teach you how to program in R (which could take an entire summer by itself)

# RStudio

## mini-DREAM activities environment

- Module activities will use a shared RStudio workspace for working with R code

- Environment located on a "cloud" computing machine in Amazon EC2

- No need to install or download anything; all required packages and data pre-loaded

```{r out.width="500px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("environment.png")
```

## What is RStudio? 

- **RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE): create, view, and explore code, variables, files, plots, etc. all in one application


```{r out.width="400px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio.png")
```

- RStudio also provides lots of helpful features that make writing R code easier

## RStudio — Layout

When you start RStudio, you will get a view similar to what is shown below with perhaps slight differences.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-home.png")
```

## RStudio — Help

A lot of information is available in RStudio in the (searchable) help tab — feel free to investigate.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-help.png")
```

## RStudio — Commands

You can type commands directly into the console.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-command1.png")
```

## RStudio — Workspace

Outputs will be saved in the current workspace.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-command2.png")
```

## RStudio — Projects

We'll be using RStudio *projects* to keep things organized.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-projects1.png")
```

## RStudio — Projects

Switching projects changes the folder you're working in.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-projects2.png")
```

## RStudio — R Notebooks

mini-DREAM activities are based in **R Notebooks**, which have `.Rmd` ... more on this in **Activity 0**.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-notebook.png")
```

## RStudio — R Notebooks

For each activity, you'll read along and run sections of code in "chunks".

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rnotebook-chunk1.png")
```

## RStudio — R Notebooks

Output from each chunk will be displayed directly below the code, and saved in the workspace.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rnotebook-chunk2.png")
```

## RStudio — R Notebooks

You can inspect the contents of outputs by clicking on object names.

```{r out.width="650px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-workspace.png")
```
